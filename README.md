Folkenroth's attempt at Distant Viewing Erasure Poetry

===
Will I finish this? Unlikely. Will it be a fun to think about in my free moments wrapping up my semester in grad school? Probably!

While you can find some computer generated blackout/ erasure poetry (check out https://github.com/mkremins/blackout), I have been thinking about utilizing some sort of software that could annotate a pdf/image of a digitized page of text. This fits in my current line of inquiry around the pushing the extent of computer vision. This method would be similar to the functions of distant viewing tools (such as https://www.distantviewing.org/) but perhaps using OCR software to "read" the words. Stretch goal is to incorporate some language modeling or incorporate relevant artistic annotations rather than solid blackout. It may be gibberish!
